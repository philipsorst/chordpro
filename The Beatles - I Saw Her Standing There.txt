[Verse 1]

             E7                     A7          E7
Well she was just seventeen and you know what I mean
        E7                               B7
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
   E           E7/G#       A      Am/C
So how could I dance with another oh,
       E       B7       E7
When I saw her standing there

 [Verse 2]

     E7                   A7         E7
Well she looked at me and I, I could see
       E7                                  B7
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
E            E7/G#       A       Am/C
She wouldn't dance with another, ooh
       E       B7       E7
When I saw her standing there

 
       A
Well my heart went boom 
       A
When I crossed that room
      A               | B7 | % | A7 | % |
And I held her hand in mine


        E7
Well we danced through the night
       A7              E7
and we held each other tight
       E7                               B7
And before too long I fell in love with her
    E          E7          A7      Am/C
Now I'll never dance with another, oh
            E7      B7      | E7 | B7 |
Oh, since I saw her standing there

And before too long I fell in love with her
    E          E7/G#       A7      Am/C
Now I'll never dance with another, ooh
