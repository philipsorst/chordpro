Doris Day â€“ Que Sera, Sera


           A
When I was just a little girl
                               E
I asked my mother, what will I be
Will I be  pretty, will I be rich
                        A
Here's what she said to me.

       D
Que Sera, Sera,
              A
Whatever will be, will be
                 E
The future's not ours, to see
             A
Que Sera, Sera
          E        A
What will be, will be.

 
            A
When I grew up and fell in love 
                                 E
I asked my sweetheart what lies ahead
Will we have rainbows day after day
                          A
Here's what my sweetheart said


       D
Que Sera, Sera,
              A
Whatever will be, will be
                 E
The future's not ours, to see
             A
Que Sera, Sera
          E        A
What will be, will be.

 
           A
Now I have children of my own
                                   E
They ask their mother, what will I be
Will I be handsome, Will I be rich
                  A
I tell them tenderly

       D
Que Sera, Sera,
              A
Whatever will be, will be
                 E
The future's not ours, to see
             A
Que Sera, Sera
          E        A
What will be, will be

 

       E     A

Que Sera, Sera
