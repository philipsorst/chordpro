 A                      Aaug

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
 D                Dm
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
A      F#m      Bm         E           A    D   A    E
  You would cry too if it happened to you

 [Verse 1]

  A                     C
Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
     A                  D
But Judy left the same time
 F          A
Why was he holding her hand
     B7                   E
When he's supposed to be mine

 [Chorus]

  A                      Aaug
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
 D                Dm
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
A      F#m      Bm         E           A    D   A    E
  You would cry too if it happened to you

 [Verse 2]

 A                   C
Play all my records, keep dancing all night
    A                   D
But leave me alone for a while
 F            A
'Til Johnny's dancing with me
      B7               E
I've got no reason to smile

 [Chorus]

 A                      Aaug
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
 D                Dm
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
A      F#m      Bm         E           A    D   A    E
  You would cry too if it happened to you

[Instrumental break over chorus chords] (substitute F# for F#m)

[Verse 3]

 A                    C
Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
       A              D
Like a queen and her king
            A
Oh, what a birthday surprise
       B7           E
Judy's wearing his ring

[Chorus]
 
A                      Aaug
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
 D                Dm
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
A      F#m      Bm         E           A    D   A    E
  You would cry too if it happened to you
 A                      Aaug
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
 D                Dm
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
A      F#m      Bm         E           A    D   A    E
  You would cry too if it happened to you
