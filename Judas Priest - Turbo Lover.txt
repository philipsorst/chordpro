E
You won't hear me, but you'll feel me
Dsus2/E          C/E             A G  E
Without warning, something's dawning, listen

[Verse 2]
E
Then within your senses
E
You'll know you're defenseless
Dsus2/E              C/E       A   G   E
How your heart beats when you run for cover
Dsus2/E              C/E            E5
You can't retreat I  spy like no other.

[Pre-Chorus]

E5
Then we race together.
We can ride forever
Dsus2/E
wrapped in horsepower,
C/E     A5 G5 E5
Driving into fury
Dsus2/E         C/E      A5  G5  B5   Bm7
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me
 
[Chorus]

E5
I'm your turbo lover
G5 D5 C5      A5      G5 E5
      Tell me there's no other
E5
I'm your turbo lover
G5 D5 D5     A5  G5  E5
      Better run for cover

[Verse 3]
   E5                            C/E
We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
    A5                         G5     E5               D5
And everything goes rushing by,  with every nerve alive
   E5                                       C/E
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
A5                         G5   E5                   B5
Love machines in a harmony,  we hear the engines cry.
 

[Chorus]
E5
I'm your turbo lover
G5 D5 C5      A5      G5 E5
      Tell me there's no other
E5
I'm your turbo lover
G5 D5 D5     A5  G5  E5
      Better run for cover

[Verse 4]
E5                              C/E
On and on we're charging to the place so many seek
   A5                   G5   E5                 D5
In perfect synchronicity  of which so many speak
   E5                                  C/E
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load
    A5                        G5   E5                  B5
And then in sheer abandonment,  we shatter and explode.
 
[Chorus]
E5
I'm your turbo lover
G5 D5 C5      A5      G5 E5
      Tell me there's no other
E5
I'm your turbo lover
G5 D5 D5     A5  G5  E5
      Better run for cover
 
[Fade Out]
E5
I'm your turbo lover
G5 D5 C5      A5      G5 E5
      Tell me there's no other
E5
I'm your turbo lover
G5 D5 D5     A5  G5  E5
      Better run for cover
E5                     G5 D5
I'm your turbo lover...
